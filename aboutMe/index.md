##Who am I?
Hi there, I'm Robin, a Software Engineer working for Ericsson.

I perfer coding with Java, and also use Python and Shell sometimes. I graduated from SCUT(South China University of Techknowledge) in 2016. So, yeah, I'm still a junior Engineer.

Besides coding, I love movies and music. Movies are microfilms of life. You can learn much from them. Music tells the emotion of singers. Sometimes you make friends with music if feel the same with the singer.
